## Independent Researcher | National Interest and Policy-Oriented Research Whitepapers and Commentary 

### 👨‍🔬 About

I am an **independent researcher** focused on applied research at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, quantitative analytics, financial risk, and data-driven policy analysis**. My work emphasizes translating rigorous research into insights that support **economic competitiveness, workforce development, technological leadership, and outcomes aligned with the national interest**.

Through open scholarship, public engagement, and policy participation, my research contributes to domains that align with **national and strategic priorities**, including innovation ecosystems, labor markets, advanced manufacturing, and resilient financial and supply-chain systems. These efforts reflect the type of sustained, high-impact work often evaluated under **national interest based research and contribution frameworks**.

### 🎓 Education & Academic Background
- **International MBA**, Bar-Ilan University (Israel)
- **Graduate Studies**, Touro College (New York City)
- **Research & Professional Activity**: United States (NY, NJ, Philadelphia region)

---

### 🔬 Research Focus Areas
- Quantitative Finance & Financial Risk Modeling  
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Systems  
- Data Science, Big Data & Statistical Analysis  
- AI Applications in Workforce, Manufacturing & Policy  
- Economic Analysis & Technology-Driven Decision Support  

---

### 🌍 Research Dissemination & Public Access

My work is intentionally distributed through **open and public channels** to maximize societal benefit, institutional reuse, and long-term national and government value, including:
- Academic and research platforms (Google Scholar, SSRN, ORCID, MPRA)
- Government and public science repositories
- Free educational resources (courses, ebooks, public lectures)
- Long-term preservation via open research archives

This approach ensures research outcomes extend beyond a single employer or commercial entity and remain accessible to **institutions, policymakers, and the public**, supporting objectives commonly associated with **national interest waiver–style public benefit analysis**.

---

### 🏛️ Government & Public-Sector Engagement

This portfolio documents research that has been:
- **Cited, indexed, or archived** by U.S. and international government institutions  
- **Referenced in economic, labor, and technology analysis**  
- **Submitted as formal public commentary** to federal agencies through established rulemaking processes  

These engagements demonstrate a sustained pathway from **independent research to public-sector relevance**, policy consideration, and measurable national impact—criteria frequently examined in **national interest evaluations**.
