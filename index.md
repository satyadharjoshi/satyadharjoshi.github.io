## Independent Researcher | National Interest and Policy-Oriented Research Whitepapers and Commentary 

### 👨‍🔬 About

I am an **independent researcher** focused on applied research at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, quantitative analytics, financial risk, and data-driven policy analysis**. My work emphasizes translating rigorous research into insights that support **economic competitiveness, workforce development, technological leadership, and outcomes aligned with the national interest**.

Through open scholarship, public engagement, and policy participation, my research contributes to domains that align with **national and strategic priorities**, including innovation ecosystems, labor markets, advanced manufacturing, and resilient financial and supply-chain systems. These efforts reflect the type of sustained, high-impact work often evaluated under **national interest based research and contribution frameworks**.
