## Portfolio and National Interest Statement

This website serves as a comprehensive, curated portfolio documenting the author's sustained scholarly, research, and policy contributions aligned with U.S. national interest priorities, including those commonly evaluated under the EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) green card framework. The foundational premise underlying this body of work is that rigorous research, innovation, and applied scholarly analysis are critical drivers of economic competitiveness, workforce development, national security, technological leadership, and long-term U.S. technological sovereignty.

The work presented here spans strategic domains such as Agentic AI, Generative AI, workforce upskilling, advanced manufacturing resilience, financial and supply-chain risk, data-driven economic analysis, and applied policy research, all of which directly support objectives emphasized across U.S. federal science, labor, commerce, and technology agendas relevant to national importance and substantial merit.

To maximize public benefit and institutional relevance, this research is disseminated through a broad, open ecosystem of platforms, including Google Scholar, ORCID, SSRN, MPRA, and other academic indexing services, as well as free public education initiatives such as open courses, ebooks, and educational video content, with long-term preservation through trusted repositories like the Open Science Framework (OSF). This open dissemination model ensures the work contributes to public interest outcomes, informs U.S. institutional expertise, and supports national interest objectives, rather than remaining confined to private or commercial use.

The national interest relevance of this body of work is further demonstrated through formal recognition, citation, and utilization by U.S. government and international public institutions, including authoritative agencies central to U.S. economic, labor, and innovation policy such as the Federal Reserve System, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the U.S. Department of Commerce library, as well as archival inclusion in Science.gov and ERIC, confirming its integration into the national research infrastructure.

Beyond citation, the research actively contributes to U.S. public policy and federal rulemaking through documented, evidence-based public comments submitted via Regulations.gov to agencies such as the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), International Trade Administration (ITA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), establishing a clear and traceable pathway from independent research to regulatory, economic, and strategic policy input.

This sustained record of government-acknowledged policy engagement, public scholarship, and national-level impact aligns with criteria frequently assessed in EB-2 NIW petitions, including independent contributions of national importance, broad societal benefit, and value beyond a single employer. In parallel, this site reflects a strictly non-commercial, volunteer commitment to knowledge sharing and mentorship, where educational materials, research examples, and EB-2 NIW preparation insights are shared freely and for informational purposes only, without charge, legal representation, or consulting services.

Collectively, this website functions as a centralized evidence hub for National Interest Waiver green card evaluation, tracing a coherent narrative from independent research and scholarly dissemination to validated government recognition and policy impact, and documenting a sustained history of advancing the national interest of the United States through research, policy engagement, and open public knowledge.
