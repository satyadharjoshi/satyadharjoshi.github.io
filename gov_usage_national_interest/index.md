## Portfolio and National Interest Guidance

This website serves as a comprehensive, curated portfolio documenting the author's sustained scholarly, research, and policy contributions aligned with U.S. national interest priorities, including those commonly evaluated under the EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) green card framework. The foundational premise underlying this body of work is that rigorous research, innovation, and applied scholarly analysis are critical drivers of economic competitiveness, workforce development, national security, technological leadership, and long-term U.S. technological sovereignty.

The work presented here spans strategic domains such as Agentic AI, Generative AI, workforce upskilling, advanced manufacturing resilience, financial and supply-chain risk, data-driven economic analysis, and applied policy research, all of which directly support objectives emphasized across U.S. federal science, labor, commerce, and technology agendas relevant to national importance and substantial merit.

To maximize public benefit and institutional relevance, this research is disseminated through a broad, open ecosystem of platforms, including Google Scholar, ORCID, SSRN, MPRA, and other academic indexing services, as well as free public education initiatives such as open courses, ebooks, and educational video content, with long-term preservation through trusted repositories like the Open Science Framework (OSF). This open dissemination model ensures the work contributes to public interest outcomes, informs U.S. institutional expertise, and supports national interest objectives, rather than remaining confined to private or commercial use.

The national interest relevance of this body of work is further demonstrated through formal recognition, citation, and utilization by U.S. government and international public institutions, including authoritative agencies central to U.S. economic, labor, and innovation policy such as the Federal Reserve System, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the U.S. Department of Commerce library, as well as archival inclusion in Science.gov and ERIC, confirming its integration into the national research infrastructure.

Beyond citation, the research actively contributes to U.S. public policy and federal rulemaking through documented, evidence-based public comments submitted via Regulations.gov to agencies such as the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), International Trade Administration (ITA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), establishing a clear and traceable pathway from independent research to regulatory, economic, and strategic policy input.

This comprehensive portfolio provides compelling evidence of significant contributions to U.S. national interest, establishing a model that other EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) green card applicants can study and emulate. The sustained track record documented here—featuring direct policy engagement with federal agencies, citation by key U.S. institutions, and demonstrable impact on American economic and security priorities—directly addresses the adjudicative criteria for a successful National Interest Waiver Green Card petition. It showcases how independent research, when strategically aligned with national imperatives, can meet the standard for independent contributions of substantial merit and national importance.

This repository is offered as a non-commercial, publicly available resource and case study for other researchers and professionals pursuing a green card through national interest waiver. The materials illustrate practical strategies for building a persuasive portfolio, including methods for securing government recognition, framing policy impact, and documenting a narrative of national importance. This free, informational resource is intended to support peer learning and the broader community of EB-2 NIW candidates by providing a transparent, real-world example of how to substantiate a waiver request. It is shared strictly for educational purposes without any charge, legal advice, or service offering.

In essence, this collection functions as a detailed blueprint and centralized evidence hub for National Interest Waiver Green Card applicants looking for topics and recent developments. It maps a clear pathway from academic contribution to validated U.S. national interest impact, offering a documented history that underscores how dedicated professionals can advance American competitiveness and security. For fellow applicants, it stands as a motivation and guidance to the power of building a robust positive approach to demonstrates a sustained commitment to the national interest of the United States.
